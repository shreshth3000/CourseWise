# CourseWise: A RAG-based Real-Time Course Recommendation System 

## Overview  
This project implements a **real-time course recommendation system** that suggests the most suitable courses for individuals based on their **previous education qualifications** and **future goals**. The system processes a list of courses provided on the spot and delivers personalized recommendations using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Processes input courses dynamically and provides instant suggestions.  
- **Personalized Matching**: Uses NLP to understand user qualifications and goals for tailored recommendations.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances response quality by combining retrieval-based and generative AI techniques.  
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Designed to handle a large number of courses and diverse user inputs.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- **Python** (Flask, LangChain, FAISS)  
- **Machine Learning & Vector Search**  

## Usage  
- Provide user details (education background, goals).  
- And that's it! Get personalized course recommendations in real time.
